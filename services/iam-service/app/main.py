"""
Main FastAPI application for the identity and access management service.

This module defines the FastAPI application with lifespan management for handling
startup and shutdown events. It manages connections to various services including
database, Redis, and Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

The application includes:
- Startup tasks: Loading RSA keys, connecting to database, Redis, and Pub/Sub
- Shutdown tasks: Closing all connections gracefully
- Health checks and monitoring

Example:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

    Lifespan context manager to handle startup and shutdown events for the FastAPI.

    This function is called when the application starts and stops, allowing
    us to perform necessary initialization and cleanup tasks such as loading RSA
    keys, connecting to databases, and managing service connections.

    During startup, this function:
    - Loads RSA key pairs for JWT signing
    - Establishes database connection
    - Connects to Redis
    - Verifies Pub/Sub topic availability

    During shutdown, this function:
    - Closes database connections
    - Closes Redis connection
    - Closes Pub/Sub connection

    Args:
        app: The FastAPI application instance.

    Yields:
        None: Yields control back to the application during its operational period.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If any of the required services fail to connect during startup.
